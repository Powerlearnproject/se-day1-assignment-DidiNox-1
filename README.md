#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
   Answer: Software Engineering refers to the principles, methods and tools utilized to develop and maintain high-quality software systems. It involves the designing, developing, testing, deploying and maintenance of software products.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
   Answer: 
   a) The development of programming languages e.g C, fotran etc. 
   b) The advent of structured programming in the 1970s.
   c) The rise of Agile methodology in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
   Answer:
i) Requirement Analysis: involves the gathering and documenting of users needs and systems requirements (functional and non-functional requirements). 
ii) Design: the creation of high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and users' interface.
iii) Implementation: the writing of codes, that is, the coding of the software product in accordance to its design specifications.
iv) Testing: conducting of various tests to ensure the software product meets its functional requirements and quality standards.
v) Deployment: releasing of the software product for use to its customers/users.
vi) Maintenance: providing ongoing supports, updates and enhancements to the software products after deployment, to strengthen it against vulnerabilities.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
   Answer: 
   Waterfall methodology is a linear sequential approach to software development life cycle in the designing and development of a software system. It follows a sequential linear progression whereby each step is dependent on the output of the previous step. It does not include the end users during the development process. For example, the development of an enterprise software.

   Agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach in software development life cycle. It focuses on flexibility, collaboration and adaptability (to changes) in software development. It involves end users in the development of software systems. For example, the use of scrum/sprints in managing the redevelopment (developing a software from an existing software).

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
   Answer:
   i) A software developer is one responsible for the writing of codes and implementing software solutions.
   ii) A quality assurance engineer ensures the quality of software systems by designing and executing test plans.
   iii) A project manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software products.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
   Answer:
   a) Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Is a software suite that provides comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing codes e.g Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, Codeblocks etc.
   b) Version Control System (VCS): Is a software tool used for tracking changes to source codes and coordinating work among team members e.g Git, Subversion etc.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
   Answer: technical debts, changing requirements, tight deadlines etc. are some challenges faced ny software engineers. 
   To overcome such challenges, strategies such as: effective communication, adoption of agile methodologies, regular reassessment of project goals and timelines, prioritization of tasks etc. should be adopted in software development.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
   Answer:
   i) Unit Testing: Is the testing of individual components or modules of software.
   ii) Integration Testing: Is the testing of interactions between different components or subsystems of a software.
   iii) System Testing: Testing the entire software as a whole.
   iv) Acceptance Testing: Is the testing of the software against users' requirements to ensure it meets users needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
   Answer: Prompt Engineering is the crafting of questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI modules. It helps one's question to be clear, concise and specific to enable the AI modules understand exactly what you need.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
   Answer: Vague Question/Prompt - Tell me about computers...
   Improved Prompt - Summarize the history of computers and how it has evolved to the present modern day. It is clear,. specific and concise..
